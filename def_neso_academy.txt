def: The thinking to define Computer Science as a Science

Objective: Defines what kind of things can be computed mechanically, how fast and the amount of space required to do so.
                - Defines and studies different models of computation and how efficiently they can solve problems.
                - Contains complexity theory(P versus NP problem => refer to compleexit-theory.txt file)

Computation Models
    0. Finite State Machine (FSM)
    1. Context Free Language (CFL)
    2. Turing Machines
    3. Undecidable    


    0. Simplest model of computaion
        Very Limited amount of memory
        Can perform ONLY very low level computaions
    1. Higher level of computaion above FSM
        Language in CLF = Set of strings
    2. Machine that can perform higher levels of computaion beyond FSM and CFL
    3. Problems that cannot be solved mechincally
