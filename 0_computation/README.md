## What is computation?

This repo is an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what computation is, and humanity's current implementation of computation.

**Disclaimer**: This is an ongoing and incomplete project to unpack these concepts and serve as my distributed memory.

def 1: the **transformation** of **sequences of symbols** by **precise rules**ยน

* symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
* to be refined: precise rules
  * example sequences:
    * 11010
    * ;\*>{11}  
      i.e. any sequence of the valid symbols

def 2: The **evolution process** of some environment, by a **sequence of "simple, local" steps**. _Church-Turing thesis_
