central question: what makes some problems SOLVABLE by computers and other NOT SOLVABLE?

Examples:
    Proof that a mathematical statement is True or False: NOT SOLVABLE.
    Add two numbers 1 + 5: SOLVABLE.

1. Perhaps we can define new models of computation that can compute the current incomputable(UNSOLVABLE) problems?
