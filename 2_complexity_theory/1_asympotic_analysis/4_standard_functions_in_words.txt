N²      : For every item in a list, 
            combine it individually
                with every item in the list
                    to produce the/a result
            
            Given 10 items:
                Every item will be combined with the 9 other items to generate a result.
                Combinations:
                    10^2 = 100
                    10 * 9 item combinations = 90, since an item does get combinted with itself, hence the 90
